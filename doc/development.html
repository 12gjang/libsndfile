<!-- pepper -->
<P>
libsndfile is being developed by a small but growing community of users
and hackers led by Erik de Castro Lopo.
People interested in helping should join the libsndfile-devel
	<A HREF="lists.html">mailing list</A>
where most of the discussion about new features takes place.
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<P>
libsndfile is being developed using the
	<A HREF="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bzr</A>
revision control system which is especially well suited to distributed
development.
It is even available for windows, but I (Erik) have not personally used it on
windows.

The main archive archive can be found at (yes, the directory looks empty,
but it isn't):
<A HREF="http://www.mega-nerd.com/Bzr/libsndfile-dev/">
			http://www.mega-nerd.com/Bzr/libsndfile-dev/</A>

<P>
Assuming that you have Bzr installed (on Debian GNU/Linux "apt-get install bzr") 
you can do:
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<PRE>
	bzr get http://www.mega-nerd.com/Bzr/libsndfile-dev/
</PRE>
<!-- pepper -->
<P>
to retreive a copy of whats currently in the public archive.
To configure, build and verify the build you can do:
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<PRE>
	./autogen.sh
	make
	make check
</PRE>
<!-- pepper -->

<P>
During the configuration stage, some later versions of aclocal (I see this 
with 1.9.X) may spew out a bunch of warning messages about underquoted 
defintions in AC_WHATEVER, but these can safely be ignored.
</P>
<P>
In order to build the sources from the Bzr archive, you will need the Python
interpreter and GNU Autogen which is available using apt-get on Debian/Ubuntu
systems or as source code available
	<A HREF="http://autogen.sf.net">here</A>
