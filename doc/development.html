<!-- pepper -->
<P>
libsndfile is being developed by a small but growing community of users
and hackers led by Erik de Castro Lopo.
People interested in helping should join the libsndfile-devel
	<A HREF="lists.html">mailing list</A>
where most of the discussion about new features takes place.
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<P>
libsndfile is being developed using the
	<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/">Gnu Arch</A>
revision control system which is especially well suited to distributed
development.
In most respects, Arch is significantly better than most other revision
control systems.
One of the few places it is lacking is support for windows.
There are a couple of win32 ports, but the only one I have used successfully
used is
	<A HREF="http://ct.radiology.uiowa.edu/~jfmeinel/tla-short-path/">
		John Meinel's</A>
cygwin version.

The main archive archive can be found at:

Assuming that you have the Gnu Arch client installed (on Debian GNU/Linux "apt-get
install tla") you can do:
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<PRE>
	tla register-archive http://www.mega-nerd.com/Arch/2004/
	tla get erikd@mega-nerd.com--2004/libsndfile--hack--0 libsndfile
	cd libsndfile
	./reconfigure.mk
</PRE>

<P>
to get a copy of whats currently in the public archive and configure it ready
for building.
Some later versions of aclocal (I see this with 1.9.4) may spew out a bunch
of warning messages about underquoted defintions in AC_WHATEVER, but these
can safely be ignored.
</P>
<P>
In order to build the sources from the Arch archive, you will need GNU
Autogen which is available
	<A HREF="http://autogen.sf.net">here</A>.
Autogen does work under Cygwin (requires libguile and guile-devel to be installed).
I haven't tried it under MinGW.
</P>
<P>
To build and check it:
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<PRE>
	make
	make check
