<P>
libsndfile is being developed by a small but growing community of users
and hackers led by Erik de Castro Lopo.
People interested in helping should join the libsndfile-devel
	<A HREF="lists.html">mailing list</A>
where most of the discussion about new features takes place.

<P>
libsndfile is being developed using the
	<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/">Gnu Arch</A>
revision control system which is especially well suited to distributed
development.
In most respects, Arch is significantly better than most other revision
control systems.
One of the few places it is lacking is support for windows.
There is a native windows binary, but it has significant problems due
to limitations on path name lengths in the windows.
There is also a Cygwin binary available, but I have not tried it.

Assuming that you have the Gnu Arch client installed (on Debian GNU/Linux "apt-get
install tla") you can do:
