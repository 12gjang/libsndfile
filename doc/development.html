<!-- pepper -->
<P>
libsndfile is being developed by a small but growing community of users
and hackers led by Erik de Castro Lopo.
People interested in helping should join the libsndfile-devel
	<A HREF="lists.html">mailing list</A>
where most of the discussion about new features takes place.
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<P>
libsndfile is being developed using the
	<A HREF="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bzr</A>
revision control system which is especially well suited to distributed
development.
In most respects, Bzr is significantly better than most other revision
control systems.
It is even available for windows, but I (Erik) have not personally used 
it on windows.

The main archive archive can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.mega-nerd.com/Bzr/libsndfile-mdev/">
			http://www.mega-nerd.com/Bzr/libsndfile-mdev/</A>
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<P>
Assuming that you have Bzr installed (on Debian GNU/Linux "apt-get install bzr") 
you can do:
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<PRE>
	bzr get http://www.mega-nerd.com/Bzr/libsndfile-mdev/
</PRE>
<!-- pepper -->
<P>
to retreive a copy of whats currently in the public archive.
To configure, build and verify the build you can do:
</P>
<!-- pepper -->
<PRE>
	./reconfigure.mk
	./configure
	make
	make check
</PRE>
<!-- pepper -->

<P>
During the configuration stage, some later versions of aclocal (I see this 
with 1.9.X) may spew out a bunch of warning messages about underquoted 
defintions in AC_WHATEVER, but these can safely be ignored.
</P>
<P>
In order to build the sources from the Bzr archive, you will need the
Python interpreter and GNU Autogen which is  available
	<A HREF="http://autogen.sf.net">here</A>.
